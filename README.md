## Architecture
 ### MVC Architecture

 We opted for MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture in our project for a multitude of reasons. First, it aligns seamlessly with the established norms for Flutter development. Additionnaly, our team's Techlead Front's personal experience with MVC has proven its effectiveness, making it a reliable choice. This architectural pattern is also incredibly straightforward and easy to explain. Moreover, MVC harmonizes effortlessly with Flutter's widget-based structure, streamlining our development process and enhancing the overall functionality of our application.
